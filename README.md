## Projects ##
- Check out the [Game:TermProject-1v1-Basketball](./Game:TermProject-1v1-Basketball/Readme.txt) for a basketball game I made that lets you play against a simple AI opponent. 
- Check out the [Linear-Regression-Report:NYC-housing](./Linear-Regression-Report:NYC-Housing/202project1%20Jonathan%20Lai%20NYC%20Housing.pdf) for a report on how the best linear regression model with different predictors can predict household income in NYC. 
- Check out the [Machine-Learning-Report:Classifying-Room-Occupancy](./Machine-Learning-Report:Classifying-Room-Occupancy/202project2%20Jonathan%20Lai%20Occupancy.pdf) for a report on the best Machine Learning model to predict a room's occupancy. 
- Check out the [Machine-Learning:Restaurant-Review-NLP](./Machine-Learning:Restaurant-Review-NLP/lr.py) for the implementation of a binary logistic regression model (ML model) on predicting whether a restaurant review is positive or negative using data from Yelp, the website with crowd-sourced reviews on different businesses. 
- Check out the [Machine-Learning:RNN-Large-Language-Model](./Machine-Learning:RNN-Large-Language-Model/rnn.py) for the implementation of a recurrent neural network large language model (ML model) that generates words and sentences given a prompt.
- Check out the [Software-Engineering:Updated-NodeBB-Forum](./Software-Engineering:Updated-NodeBB-Forum/Readme.txt) for a new repository with a new implementation of the NodeBB Forum platform.
- Check out the [Software-Engineering:Oppia-Open-Source-Contribution](./Software-Engineering:Oppia-Open-Source-Contribution/Readme.txt) for the pull requests that fixes an issue on the Oppia Open Source project.
- Check out the [Web-Development:Say-It-With-Sweets-Website](./Web-Development:Say-It-With-Sweets-Website/Readme.txt) for a repository with the source code of a local sweet shop's website.
